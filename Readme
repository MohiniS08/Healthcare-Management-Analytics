# **Healthcare Management Analytics**
A data-driven healthcare analytics project built using SQL and Power BI to analyze hospital management data. The project aims to provide actionable insights into patient demographics, doctor performance, treatment trends, revenue generation, and overall hospital efficiency.

# **Project Overview**
- Created a Hospital Management Database with tables: Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Treatment, Billing.
- Performed SQL queries to answer 25 business questions related to patients, doctors, treatments, appointments, and revenue.
- Desiged a Power BI Dashboard to visualize KPIs and provided interactive insights.

Note: This dataset is used for educational and analytical purposes.

# **SQL Analysis**
1: How many patients are registered in the hospital by gender?
2: Age distribution of patients
3: Insurance provider patients
4: Top 10 patients who spent the most money
5: Insurance provider with the highest claims (billed via insurance)
6: Number of doctors per specialization
7: Average years of experience by specialization
8: Doctors per hospital branch
9: Revenue per doctor
10: Number of appointment per month

18: Most common treatment type
19: AVG treatment cost by type
20: Treatments performed per month
21: Tretament cost per hospital branch
22: Whcih hospital branch generates the most revenue
23: Total revenue by payment method
24: Total revenue per month
25: Pending or failed payments
